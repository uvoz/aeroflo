# aeroflo
usefull printable (rubber) parts for the Aeroflo from GHE General Hydroponics Europe



## Tested with Primaloy
Our rubber parts are printed with the Primalloy fillament from Verbatim. It's a similar material like soft skateboard-wheels and has excellent cohesion. Haven't seen it de-laminating. Print solid .1mm layers at 20mm/second on 235C with the bed heated at 50C.
Other flexible fillaments might work as well.

## Lid for unused plant-holes (netcup lid)
When growing large tomatoes, one would not use all holes. Here a decent lid. Insert the lid with the flat side up to avoid dirt and rainwater build-up.

## Main water-pipe to sprayer hoses rubber interface connector
After running the Auroflo for 3+ years! the original rubber sprayer tube connectors became brittle this spring. Her an improved, slight conic shaped version. It's snugger then the original part.
