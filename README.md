# aeroflo
usefull printable (rubber) parts for the Aeroflo from GHE General Hydroponics Europe



## Primaloy
The rubber parts are printed with the Primalloy fillament from Verbatim. It's a similar material like soft skateboard-wheels and has excellent cohesion. Haven't seen it de-laminating. Print solid .1mm layers at 20mm/second on 235C with the bed heated at 50C.
