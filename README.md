# aeroflo
usefull printable (rubber) parts for the Aeroflo from GHE General Hydroponics Europe



## Main water-pipe to sprayer hoses rubber interface connector
After running the Aeroflo for 3+ years! the original rubber sprayer tube connectors became brittle this spring. This an improved, slight conic shaped version. It's snugger then the original part.

## Water-pipe vibration damper
We like our system on the teras very silent. The main (pump) noise is pushed out trough the water-pipes that resonate on the stands where they lay on.
This simple object slides over the upper square pipes of your system and provides a soft noise-absorbing bed when printed with soft & flexible fillament. For the printing: 10-15% infill makes the object nice fluffy.

## Lid for unused plant-holes
When growing large tomatoes, one would not use all holes. Here a decent lid. Insert the lid with the flat side up to avoid dirt and rainwater build-up.

## Tested with Primaloy
We printed the rubber parts with the Primalloy fillament from Verbatim. It's a similar material like soft skateboard-wheels and has excellent cohesion. Haven't seen it de-laminating. Print solid .1mm layers at 20mm/second on 235C with the bed heated at 50C.
Other flexible fillaments might work as well.
